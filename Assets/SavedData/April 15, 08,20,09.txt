You now have 2 lives.

The dealer now has 2 lives.

A panel in the table flips over to reveal its other side. Attached to it are three shotgun shells. One is <color="red">red</color>. The others are <color="blue">blue</color>.

The dealer speaks.

"1 <color="red">live</color> round. 2 <color="blue">blanks</color>."

The dealer starts to load the shells into the shotgun without looking.

"I insert the rounds in an unknown order."
