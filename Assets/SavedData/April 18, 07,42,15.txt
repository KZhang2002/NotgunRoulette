You now have 2 lives.

The dealer now has 2 lives.

A panel in the table flips over to reveal its other side. Attached to it are three shotgun shells. One is <color="red">red</color>. The others are <color="blue">blue</color>.

The dealer speaks.

"1 <color="red">live</color> round. 2 <color="blue">blanks</color>."

The dealer starts to load the shells into the shotgun without looking.

"I insert the rounds in an unknown order."

The dealer pumps the shotgun, sets it down on the table, and slides it to you.

"Your turn."
